# mg-press
Wordpress + Composer + Twig

## Installation
  
    1) Install Using Composer
        composer create-project mindgruve/mg-press path/to/project "dev-master"
  
    2) Ignore the following files and directories:
        application/config/wpConfig.yml
        application/vendor
        web/wp
  
    3) Update your configuration file located at config/wpConfig.yml with your 
        database parameters, theme name, and updated secure hashes.
    
    4) Complete the WP Installation.  For example, using localhost
        http://localhost/wp/wp-admin/install.php

    5) Login to to WP Admin and go to Settings > General
        update the Site Address (URL) to be at your web root.
        For example, using localhost your site address setting would be: http://localhost/
      
    6) Download and install ACF Plugin (which is a dependency to run)

## WordPress Configuration

MgPress uses a YAML to configure your WordPress installation.   
The config file is located at **[project-root]/config/wpConfig.yml**    
If the wpConfig.yml file doesn't exist, it will be copied over from wpConfig.yml.dist when you perform a composer install or update.

## Environmental Variables

You can also set configuration by using environmental variable substitution.  
This is helpful if you need to package your application in a docker container or if you utilize continuous integration.

MgPress follows the same syntax as Apache - ${ENVIRONMENTAL_VARIABLE}  
For example if you had the following entries in your wpConfig.yml..

    DB_NAME:          '$(DATABASE_NAME)'
    DB_USER:          '$(DATABASE_USER)'
    DB_PASSWORD:      '$(DATABASE_PASSWORD)'
    DB_HOST:          '$(DATABASE_HOST)'

Then the environmental variables DATABASE\_NAME, DATABASE\_USER, DATABASE\_PASSWORD, and DATABASE\_HOST will be used.
